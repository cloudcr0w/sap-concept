# 🧪 Real Case: Controlled Industrial Material Transfer in SAP

This document presents a real-world simulation of a secure, high-value material transfer between two industrial facilities. It demonstrates multi-day coordination between logistics, quality control, and security teams using SAP MM movement types.

---

## 🧭 Scenario Overview

**Context:**  
A by-product from heavy industrial processing is transferred regularly from a production plant to a downstream facility for final refinement. The material requires secure handling, official sampling, and full traceability.

**Material characteristics:**
- Fine particulate (powder/granulate)
- Requires sealable containers and inspection before release
- Moderate to high value – subject to controlled handover

---

## 🏗️ Daily Production Overview

- Material is produced **daily**, typically filling **2 sealed containers per shift**
- Each container:
  - Tare weight: ~300 kg
  - Filled weight: ~900–1000 kg
  - Uniquely identified, weighed, and staged

---

## 📆 Process Timeline – Two-Day Cycle

### 📅 Day 1 – Sampling and Staging

1. **Container Filling and Staging**
   - Containers filled and weighed by production operators.
   - Transferred to a restricted storage area under 24/7 surveillance.

2. **Quality Sampling**
   - Quality Control (QC) extracts **2 kg** of material per container.
   - Sample taken under 4-party protocol:
     - Production operator
     - QC technician
     - Lab analyst
     - Security officer

3. **Sealing**
   - Each container is sealed with **4 independent physical seals**.
   - Seal numbers recorded and matched to container IDs.

4. **Sample Delivery**
   - Combined samples from each batch are escorted to the lab.
   - **250g final sample** per batch retained for retention/testing.

5. **SAP Processing (Sample Allocation)**
   - Dispatcher is informed and creates reservation in SAP.
   - **Movement 309**: Transfers sample quantity from central index to local lab index.
   - **Movement 313**: Transfer initiated to QA-controlled stock.

---

### 📅 Day 2 – Shipment to Second Plant

1. **Final Weighing and Documentation**
   - Each container is weighed using industrial scale.
   - Printed report with gross/net weights signed by:
     - Warehouse staff
     - Logistics operator
     - Receiving plant delegate

2. **SAP Material Movement**
   - Based on weighed net values, movement type **309** is used to reclassify full batch to shipping index.
   - Matched to corresponding QC sample.

3. **Transfer to Outbound Staging**
   - Containers and retention samples are staged together.
   - **Movement 315**: Material officially handed over to outbound storage (Finished Goods area).

4. **Loading and Dispatch**
   - Forklift loads containers to designated vehicle.
   - Final document check, seal inspection, and authorization by security.
   - Vehicle departs with signed transfer order and matched QC documentation.

## 🔄 SAP Transactions Used

| Transaction        | Purpose                                  |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `MB1B / MIGO`       | 309, 313, 315 movements                  |
| `QA32`              | Inspection lot monitoring (if applicable)|
| `/SCWM/MON`         | Monitor internal movements               |
| `/SCWM/ADHU`        | Adjust HU bin locations                  |
| `/SCWM/TO_CONF`     | Confirm internal tasks                   |

## 🔐 Key Control Measures

- Secure area with surveillance & limited access
- Seal-based container verification (4-party protocol)
- Chain-of-custody for sampling and shipment
- SAP-based movement tracking + physical documentation
- Daily handovers and logs for cross-plant audit

---

## 🧩 Lessons Learned / Key Insights
- **Traceability first:** seal IDs + HU IDs + SAP movements = auditable chain-of-custody.
- **QA integration is critical:** inspection timing drives stock-type and bin decisions.
- **Weighing discipline:** weight tickets aligned with SAP postings prevent reconciliation drift.
- **Staging discipline:** physical co-location of HUs with documentation reduces loading errors.
- **Role clarity:** 4-party protocol eliminates single points of failure in approvals.
