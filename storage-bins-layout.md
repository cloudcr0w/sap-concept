This document describes a sample warehouse layout and bin logic structure used in SAP Extended Warehouse Management (eWM).

## 🧠 Example Strategies

- **Putaway (0100 → 0050):** FIFO, fixed bins for A-items, open-bin for B/C.
- **Picking (0050 → 0200):** Activity-area sequence, cluster picking for small picks.
- **QA Segregation (0150):** Stock type control; release to unrestricted after usage decision.


## 🧱 Storage Types and Example Bins

| Storage Type | Description                  | Example Bins        |
|--------------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| 0100         | Goods Receipt Zone           | GR01, GR02, GR03    |
| 0150         | Quality Inspection Zone      | QA01, QA02          |
| 0050         | High-Rack Storage            | BIN_A01 to BIN_A50  |
| 0200         | Outbound / Staging           | STG01, STG02        |

## 📌 Notes

- Storage types are logical sections in eWM that guide task creation and putaway strategies.
- Bin naming convention can follow zone and rack logic (e.g., BIN_A12 = Aisle A, Level 1, Position 2).
- Movement strategies (e.g. FIFO, fixed bin) are defined per storage type.
