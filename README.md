# 📦 SAP eWM Concept Project

Welcome to the **SAP Extended Warehouse Management (eWM) Process Simulation** project.

This repository presents a conceptual overview of typical warehouse processes modeled with SAP eWM terminology. Although it's not connected to a live SAP system, it demonstrates:

- Realistic warehouse operations based on industry practice (e.g., inbound, outbound, stock transfer)
- Mapping to eWM terms (storage bins, putaway, picking, etc.)
- Practical experience with SAP MM/WM and process logic

This project is especially useful for recruiters or hiring managers looking for candidates with warehouse operations experience who are transitioning into SAP eWM consulting.

## 🚚 Sample Use Case: Medium-sized Industrial Warehouse

- 3 storage areas: Receiving → High-rack storage → Staging for outbound
- Multiple movement types (putaway, internal transfer, pick/pack)
- FIFO logic, inventory visibility, storage bin management

## 💻 Bonus – Technical Background

Alongside my SAP/logistics background, I also develop projects in cloud and DevOps technologies (AWS, Terraform, CI/CD, Docker). This strengthens my ability to:

- Automate and simulate warehouse processes with code
- Rapidly adapt to SAP-BTP, SAP on AWS, or hybrid IT/SAP environments
- Contribute to integration, testing, and technical documentation efforts
